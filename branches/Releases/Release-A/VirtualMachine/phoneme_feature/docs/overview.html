&gt; Software Overview
</p>

<p>
phoneME&#153; Feature is an open source version of the Sun Java&#153; 
Wirless Client Software, a high-performance platform, based on an optimized 
implementation of the Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC) and Mobile 
Information Device Profile (MIDP) software stack, which includes support for 
many Java Specification Requests (JSRs). 

<p>
phoneME Feature is a flexible, high quality implementation for developers 
who port MIDP and associated technologies to mobile devices. It is also 
useful to application developers who want to work with the very latest Java ME 
technologies, even before these technologies are ported to real devices.
</p>

<h2 class="Head1">Architecture</h2>

<p>
phoneME Feature consists of three fundamental layers, as shown in the 
following diagram.
</p>

<img src="./images/stack_layers.jpg"/>

<p>
phoneME Feature is shown in blue. It is made up of three primary pieces:

<p>
<ul>
<li>MIDP/CLDC - The fundamental platform stack that makes up the core of the  
phoneME Feature software. CLDC defines the base set of application programming 
interfaces and a virtual machine for resource-constrained devices. MIDP provides an 
application environment and a wide range of application services. CLDC and MIDP are
defined through the Java Community Process (JCP&#153;) by JSRs 139 and 118, 
respectively. 

<p>
<li>Optional Package JSRs - Optional functionality added to the fundamental platform 
stack, which includes (among others in the phoneME Feature software) the 
Multimedia API (JSRs 135 and 234), Bluetooth (JSR 82), and the Mobile Sensor API 
(JSR 256). 

<p>
<li>Abstraction layer - A set of functionality that allows all JSRs to talk to 
MIDP/CLDC through a common set of interfaces. 
</ul>

<p>
Applications (MIDlets) run on top of the phoneME Feature software.  When 
phoneME Feature runs multiple MIDlets, it uses a single OS process. 
Therefore, a single instance of Java virtual machine can execute several applications 
simultaneously, providing each of them with a separate runtime environment. All 
running applications are isolated so that from the application's point of view, it 
looks as if each application is executed in its own virtual machine.


<p>
The JavaCall&#153; API distills the platform requirements of the entire phoneME 
Feature software platform to a single set of functions that must be ported. 
All porting is done at the same layer, and the JavaCall functions are consistently 
named and well documented.

<p>
Information on porting is in the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/docs/sjwc-2.1/pdf-html/html/porting-users/index.html">
Sun Java Wireless Client Software Porting User's Guide</a>.
The comprehensive
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/docs/sjwc-2.1/javacall_doxygen/html/index.html">
JavaCall API</a> reference contains specific information on every function and every argument.

<p>
JSR 239 Java Binding for the OpenGL&reg; ES API is a notable exception. It
binds to a standardized API and no additional JavaCall layer is needed.
JSR 239 provides a direct binding to the OpenGL ES implementation.
