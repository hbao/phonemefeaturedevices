<h2 class="Head1">Introduction</h2>

<p>
phoneME&#153; Feature is an open source version of the Sun Java&#153; 
Wireless Client Software product from Sun Microsystems, an optimized Java 
platform, Micro Edition (Java ME) stack.  phoneME Feature supports 
multitasking and is built upon MIDP 2.1.  For more information about

<h2 class="Head1">Platform Requirements</h2>

<p>
Following are the supported target platforms for <i>running</i> an
implementation of phoneME Feature:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows/x86

<p>
For more information on platform compatibilities, build tools, and other 
build considerations, see the

<h2 class="Head1">Implementation Notes</h2>

<a name="linux-arm"></a>
<h3>Support for Linux on ARM Platform</h3>
<p>

phoneME Feature MR3 software supports building on Linux for the ARM 
target platform.  However, because embedded platforms such as Linux on 
ARM tend to be very specific, phoneME Feature MR3 has been ported to the 
Texas Instruments P2SAMPLE64-V6 board as a sample ARM platform. It does 
not consitute a fully-qualified port, but is meant to serve as a starting
point for Linux on ARM platforms in general.
<p>
For more information on building phoneME Feature for the Linux on ARM
platform, see the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/docs/sjwc-2.1/pdf-html/html/build/index.html">
Sun Java Wireless Client Software Build Guide</a>.
<p>

<a name="mt-qts"></a>
<h3>MT-QTS No Longer Supported</h3>
<p>

Support for the Multitasking Quality Test Suite (MT-QTS) has been dropped in 
phoneME Feature. Future support for Multitasking Test Suite will be made 
available in the next release of the Java Device Test Suite (JDTS) from Sun 
Microsystems.
</p>

<a name="keypress"></a>
<h3>Quick Key Presses in WTK 2.5.2 Can Lose Key Strokes</h3>
<p>

phoneME Feature is dependent on components of Wireless Toolkit (WTK) 2.5.2 for 
emulation on Win32 platforms. In phoneME Feature builds on Win32 platforms 
with WTK 2.5.2, very quick, repeated keypresses from QWERTY keyboards can be lost. 
To bypass the problem, press repeated keys with a pause of 500ms or more.  Users 
should be careful typing passwords and URLs. (See bug 6682099 in Known Bugs, below.)
</p>

<a name="heap-size"></a>
<h3>JAVA_HEAP_SIZE Property Value Incorrect</h3>
<p>
MIDlets installed in SVM mode are unable to be run twice, with no 
error messages appearing in the console.  The problem is caused by 
an incorrect value in JAVA_HEAP_SIZE in the jwc_properties.ini file. 
(See bug 6680850 in Known Bugs, below.)
</p>

<a name="path_crash"></a>
<h3>Source Root Directory Path Length May Cause Unpredictable Build Crashes</h3>
<p>
Due to an inconsistency in Cyg4me, phoneME Feature source root directory path 
names that are too long or too short may (or may not) cause <code>make</code> to crash 
during building, with the following error message:
<p>
<ul>
    4 [main] sh 1560 handle_exceptions: Exception: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION
<br>
  653 [main] sh 1560 open_stackdumpfile: Dumping stack trace to sh.exe.stackdump
<br>
 make: *** [xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx] Error 10112
</ul>
<p>
There are no strict rules for how long or how short a source root directory path 
must be to successfully sidestep this bug. If it occurs, work around it by 
shortening or lengthening your source root directory path names.  (See bug 
6393610 in Known Bugs, below.)

        Specific JavaCall API for WTK implementation issue - to be solved
	during porting to particular platform. Key-typed WTK events generated
	JAVACALL_KEYPRESSED events only, no paired JAVACALL_RELEASED were 
	posted to MIDP. It caused noticeable delay for multiple character 
	typing from keyboard. The problem appears only if some key is pressed
	quickly more than one time (like 'ss' in the word 'password'); it's 
	possible to pass test pressing keys with some delay.
